Go to Top

The Dataset is taken from NYU Stern School of Business, Econometric Analysis, 5th Edition. Panel dataset consists of cross-sectional data, containing cost data of US airlines for 15 years from 1970 to 1984.

There is a total of 90 observations on 6 airline firms. These data are a subset of a larger data set provided to the author by Professor Moshe Kim. They were originally constructed by Christensen Associates of Madison, Wisconsin.



1.1 Variables in Panel Data
In this panel dataset variables used are:

I = Airline,
T = Year,
PF = Fuel price,
LF = Load factor, the average capacity utilization of the fleet.
Q = Output, in revenue passenger miles, index number,
C = Total cost, in $1000, the data


1.2 Description Of Variables
Go to Top

I (Airline): I indicate different airline firms and here we are having 6 airline firms.

T (Year): T indicates the year for which cross-sectional data is being observed. Here the duration of T is from 1970 -1984 i.e., for 15 years.

PF (Fuel Price): The index and price data show the global average price paid at the refinery for aviation jet fuel on the reported date. Fuel Price is always determined by a contract negotiated between an Airline firm and the aviation fuel provider. It is usually a multi-year contract with terms and conditions that determine the price irrespective of the market fluctuation.

LF (Load Factor): It is a measure of how much of an airline's passenger carrying capacity has been utilized. It generally depends upon flight seating capacity, airline route, demand, etc.,

Q (revenue passenger miles): A revenue passenger mile (RPM) is a transportation industry metric that shows the number of miles traveled by paying passengers and is typically an airline traffic statistic.

Cost (1000, the data): Depends on various factors including Fuel Price, Load Factor, Lease & Depreciation, Aircraft Maintenance, Labor, and Airport Handling Charges
